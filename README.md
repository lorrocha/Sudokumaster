WHAT IT WILL BE:

In the process of being converted to a Sudoku GEM that produces sudoku puzzles, and when questioned, helps solve sudoku puzzles.

This is the bare bones of the sudoku solver in effect.

TO DO:
 * Add a visual board element for the game in the terminal
 * Add a sudoku scraper so it can generate varied sudoku puzzles
 * Add a 'user input' function that will allow people to put in their own input to play the game.
